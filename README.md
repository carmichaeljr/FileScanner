# FileScanner
A file scanner that scans a given directory for preset bad file types.

This script requires python 3 or greater installed.
<p>
No changes will be made to the file system when this script runs, unless you manually delete/change/modify the files yourself. The preset file types can be changed through the Edit menu. The files are grouped into three categories:
  
    . Known Bad: Files that have a extension in the known-bad list will be grouped here
    . Known Good: Files that have a extension in the known-good list will be grouped here
    . Unknown: Files that are not in either known-good or known-bad list will be grouped here
